                The first and most crucial step in fraud recovery is acting
                swiftly and decisively. Time is of the essence when dealing with
                fraud, as delaying can significantly hinder your chances of
                recovering your losses. Gather all relevant information, such as
                transaction records, communication logs, and any other evidence
                that can help you understand the fraudulent activity. Take
                screenshots of online interactions, fraudulent emails, or
                suspicious website pages to preserve the evidence. Immediately
                inform any fraud recovery agency known to you to proceed with
                the recovery process.
