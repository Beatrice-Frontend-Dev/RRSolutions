              With any wealth and investment recovery case, the starting point
              is to investigate the company involved. This is to see if they are
              a regulated company or not, or if they themselves are the victim
              of a cryptocurrency scam. Our team of investment fraud lawyers
              will examine the strengths and weaknesses of your case and how
              best to determine the recovery of your lost investment.

            <div class="accordion-writeup">
              Through a range of techniques, from financial complaints to legal
              proceedings, we can seek recovery from either the financial
              institution that should have detected and prevented the fraud to
              the scammer themselves, providing they have assets that we can
              seek recovery from.

              Yes, we have a team of financial recovery experts who specialise
              in getting back money lost to scammers. We will review all of the
              financial transactions in relation to the fraud and if we believe
              that more could have been done to protect you from fraud then we
              will complain to the relevant financial institution and seek
              redress. Where a scammer with assets can be identified, we can
              also pursue them through the courts.

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-writeup">
              Yes, we can trace and recover lost to crypto scams. Using
              Chainalysis Reactor software, our experts will attempt to trace
              cryptocurrency through the blockchain to an endpoint which is
              usually a crypto asset exchange provider.

              Yes. You can contact the relevant financial institution to try to
              recover your money yourself. You can also make a complaint if
              you're not happy with the response you receive. However, if you
              would like us to do this for you, we will use our technical
              knowledge and legal expertise to give you the best chance of
              success. We'll also be able to represent you in the event our
              advice is to pursue this through the courts.

              You may believe that you were at fault for authorising the payment

              may have also been put off by your bank if they've refused to
              refund your money. However, we're experts in financial rules,
              regulations, codes of conduct, banking laws and legal processes
